```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```

Import your measurements.csv file into an object called MData
```{r}
MData <- read.csv("Data/measurements.csv")
```

Use a dplyr command AND regular expressions to add a new column called Sp that modifies the Species names with only the first letter and period. For example: Homo sapiens in the original Species column becomes H. sapiens in the Sp column. HINT: You can think of the regular expression commands like sub, grep, grepl and gsub as equations for strings
```{r}
MData <- MData %>% mutate(Sp = sub("(\\w)(\\w+)", "\\1\\.", Species))
```

Use a dplyr command to create a new dataset BUT with Sp column instead of the Species column, moved to the beginning in place of the original Species column
```{r}
NData <- MData %>% select(Sp, everything(), -Species)
```
